# Gibbs Samping Dirichlet Multinomial Model
CompLing Final Project GSDMM Implementation as outlined in Yin and Wang (2014)
To Do's
- 2 data sets, 1 short texts and 1 long text
    - Pang and Lee (2004) Movie review dataset
    - 2015NAACL VSM-NLP workshop-"Short Text Clustering via Convolutional Neural Networks" dataset
- pro-process corpora the same way; use the same pro-processing procedures as in the papers (Mazora; Yin amnd Wang)
- Create a toy corpus for testing
- Initialize
- Write function to calculate the posterior probability for sampling new topic
- Show words in documents of the final clusters
- Show results/evaluate per metrics in the Y and W paper
